# King of St Lucia

_King of St Lucia_ is a digital board game in a command line interface. Players
battle for supremacy in a king-of-the-hill style fight for survival.
Of course, it is closely based off the _actual_ board game, _"King of Tokyo"_.  
More information on how to run and play the game can be found within the
assignment specification in `ass3_spec.pdf`.

It was completed as part of a computing assignment at University of Queensland
(which is situated in the Brisbane suburb of Saint Lucia, hence the name). The
assignment itself is designed to teach inter-process communication and
manipulation principles, such as pipes, forking and interrupts.
